# ZenDesk Refresher
This is a Browser Extension for refreshing filters on ZenDesk.

It can be added to Chrome [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zendesk-filter-refresher/kbnadckimgmhcchlnoddmihobfmloocp)

The FireFox Add-on can be added [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zendesk-refresher/)

I created this since the one created by [brandonstubbs](https://github.com/brandonstubbs/ZendeskRefresh) is no longer working.
I plan on maintaining this one, and plan to improve it as time progresses.

You can change the default interval (10) by clicking the extension icon, entering the desired interval, and clicking Save. If you already have ZenDesk open, you shouldn't have to refresh the page in order for the interval to update.
